## Ten Domains
1. **Anime** – I enjoy watching anime and I think for the general community watching anime is part of their routine life. For me and my friends we often watch 3 to 10 episodes per week, but I never kept track of the animes I watched and its hard to share animes because I watch anime in Chinese but my friends in English.
2. **Video game Helpers** – I am a huge fan of Nintendo Switch games like splatoon and hollow knight, I also play a wide range of games both mobile and PC. I don't keep track of games I play and sometimes I leave them unfinished. I also like to play together with friends.
3. **Art & 3D modeling tools** – As a very creative person I like to sketch, 3D model, and do all sorts of creative stuff. Sometimes I get inspired by things around me but don't note them down. Would also be cool if I can learn 3D model stuff through playing a game.
4. **Concentration & productivity gamification** – I like tro track productivity/it makes me feel rewarded. However I dont have a good way to because its too much effort to log my own hours. I wish I can focus better tho.
5. **Food exploration & grocery tracking** – I really enjoy eating out and trying new foods with friends, but I never keep track of what I’ve tried or what I liked the most. Sometimes I buy groceries and forget what I already have at home, which leads to wasted food. I think it would be nice to have a way to log meals I enjoyed and plan grocery runs better so I don’t overbuy.
6. **Fashion & digital magazines** – I create a fashion magazines for MIT. Sometimes I see styles that catch my attention, but I don’t save them and later can’t find them again. I wish I had a personal space to collect those inspirations and maybe share them with friends who have similar taste.
7. **Tabletop / virtual pets** – Growing up I always liked my talking cat Tom and little virtual companions. I think having a small pet on my phone or desktop would be fun and motivating, especially if it reacts to what I do in real life, like finishing tasks or studying. It would make my day feel less serious and give me a sense of companionship.
8. **Jewelry documentation** – I’ve collected quite a bit of jewelry over time, but I often forget where I’ve put certain pieces or what I already own. Sometimes I buy new items without realizing I already have something similar. I wish I had a kind of virtual shelf where I could catalog my jewelry, so I can easily browse what I have and decide what to wear or buy next.
9. **Money management for students** – I always find it hard to keep track of my spending. A lot of times I just use my card and don’t really know how much I’ve spent until I check my bank account at the end of the month. I think it would be helpful to have a clear, simple tool to manage budgets or savings without being too complicated or intimidating.
10. **Bike life** – I just bought a bike recently and I’ve started riding around campus and to nearby places. It’s fun, but I don’t really log my rides or know how much distance I cover. Sometimes I also forget to check on basic maintenance like pumping tires. I think it would be nice to have an app that reminds me about upkeep and lets me see my progress over time.

## Focus on Three
### Anime
Anime is something I engage with every week, and it has become a routine part of how I relax and connect with friends. For me, the challenge isn’t just watching shows but keeping track of them across languages and platforms. Sometimes I watch in Chinese while my friends watch in English, and this creates a disconnect when we want to share episodes or recommend new shows. I’ve also noticed that I easily lose track of where I left off in a series, especially when I am following multiple shows at once. Because anime discussions are often very social, I feel there is a real opportunity for a tool that not only tracks my watch history but also translates titles and episode numbers across languages so that I can connect more easily with my friends. It could even suggest what to watch next based on overlap in our histories. This domain stands out to me because anime is not just entertainment, it is part of my identity and my social circle, and solving this problem would make it much easier to share that part of myself with others.

### Jewelry Documentation
My jewelry collection has grown over the years, but I don’t have a clear overview of what I own. Some pieces are stored in boxes, others in drawers, and as a result I sometimes forget what I have and default to wearing the same few items. This is frustrating because jewelry is meant to be expressive, yet I’m not making full use of it. On top of that, when I buy new pieces, I don’t have a quick way to reference my collection to avoid duplicates or to balance my styles. I imagine a “virtual jewelry shelf” where I could upload photos, tag the pieces (necklace, earrings, rings), note their storage location, and maybe even add information like materials or occasions when I wore them. This would give me both an organizational system and a source of inspiration when planning outfits. I think this domain is exciting because it’s very personal to me, but it also touches on a common problem for anyone who enjoys fashion or accessories—helping people rediscover and actually use the things they already love.

# Concentration & Productivity Gamification
Focus is something I’m constantly chasing. I often feel that I spend more time thinking about how to stay productive than actually being productive. I’ve tried timers, to-do lists, and habit trackers, but they usually require too much manual input, which becomes another task I end up avoiding. What excites me is the idea of borrowing mechanics from video games—something I’m already motivated by—and applying them to daily work. For example, instead of just checking a box when I finish reading, I could gain “experience points” toward a character that levels up, or defeat a “boss” that represents procrastination. This approach reframes productivity from being a burden into something playful and rewarding. I can see it being especially useful for students and young adults like me, who are used to interactive feedback and want their progress to feel visible and meaningful. The potential here is broad because while the theme can be playful, the underlying value is serious: it helps people focus better and enjoy the process rather than dread it. But it is also important to keep everything simple.

## Problem
### Domain 1: Anime
1. **Cross-language sharing** – Hard to share anime recommendations across Chinese and English versions.
2. **Watch history tracking** – Difficult to keep track of progress when juggling multiple shows.
3. **Discovering new shows** – Too many options, hard to pick the next one to watch/not sure which seasonal anime is airing.

### Domain 2: Jewelry Documentation
1. **Inventory tracking** – Forgetting what jewelry I already own.
2. **Storage location** – Not remembering where a piece is physically stored.
3. **Outfit pairing** – Difficulty deciding what matches with today’s clothes.

### Domain 3: Concentration & Productivity Gamification
1. **High-effort logging** – Existing productivity tools feel like extra work.
2. **Lack of motivation** – Tasks feel boring without rewards or feedback.
3. **Inconsistent focus** – Hard to build consistent habits over time.

## Selected Problems

### 1. Watch History Tracking (Anime)
When I follow multiple shows at once, I often lose track of which episode I last watched, especially if I take a break for a week or two. Streaming platforms sometimes don’t sync properly across devices or languages, so my progress can get scattered. This is worth solving because anime fans tend to follow several shows each season, and a simple, centralized tracker could remove the frustration of resuming a series. I included this because it is a widespread problem with a clear software solution.

### 2. Inventory Tracking (Jewelry)
I own many pieces of jewelry but often forget what I have, so I end up wearing the same items repeatedly or buying similar pieces. A solution that provides a visual catalog could help me rediscover forgotten pieces and avoid duplicates. I chose this because it’s very personal, and I think it could also resonate with anyone who collects fashion items. It feels achievable with simple photo-based software.

### 3. High-effort Logging (Productivity)
Most productivity tools require too much manual input—timers, notes, or check-ins—which ironically eats into the time I want to spend working. The real need is for a low-friction way to track progress that still feels rewarding. I selected this because it directly addresses why many focus tools fail and connects to my idea of gamifying productivity into something playful.

## Excluded Problems

### Domain 1: Anime
- **Cross-language sharing** – This is a real issue, but shouldn't be the focus because not a lot of people will be in this multi-lingual scenerio.
- **Discovering new shows** – A very common problem, but most people choose to watch videos made by content creators they like instead to get recs instead of needing an app.

### Domain 2: Jewelry Documentation
- **Storage location** – Useful, but can be solved with a feature not a entire app.
- **Outfit pairing** – Matching outfits is fun, but would require all of your personized clothing data in the app which is not that easy to obtain.

### Domain 3: Concentration & Productivity Gamification
- **Lack of motivation** – Important, but somewhat abstract; gamification in itself already addresses this.
- **Inconsistent focus** – Building consistent habits is valuable, but solving it fully requires behavioral science and long-term interventions, which may go beyond the scope of a class project.

## Stakeholders

### Problem 1: Watch History Tracking (Anime)

**Stakeholders**
1. **Anime watchers** – Regular viewers who follow multiple shows.
The most directly affected; they waste time trying to remember progress or accidentally rewatching episodes.

2. **Streaming platforms** – Services like Crunchyroll, Bilibili, or Netflix.
could benefit from better user retention if viewers had a unified way to track progress, but might also resist integration with outside apps as many have built in functions already.
3. **Anime Producers** – Producers that own the anime property and airs the weekly anime.
They control the copy write & other problems that might be related when trying to make an app using their graphics.



---

### Problem 2: Inventory Tracking (Jewelry)

**Stakeholders**
1. **Jewelry owners** – People who have collections and want to organize them.
They are directly impacted by forgetting what they have, leading to duplicate purchases or underusing their collection.
2. **Retailers/designers** – Stores or brands that sell jewelry.
Better tracking could either reduce impulse buying (negative for sales) or encourage more thoughtful purchases (positive for long-term engagement). There can also be ads involved.
3. **Friends/peers** – People who might gift or borrow jewelry.
Friends often discuss a certain piece of jewry in conversaion, and they are also affected by the taste and choices of the poeple around them.

---

### Problem 3: High-effort Logging (Productivity)

**Stakeholders**
1. **Students/young professionals** – People trying to balance work, study, and life.
This is directly impacted because high-effort logging discourages them from sticking with productivity tools, leaving them frustrated.
2. **Employers/teachers** – Those who benefit from improved focus and output.
They benefit indirectly: when individuals can focus better, their performance and contributions improve.

3. **App developers** – Creators of productivity tools.
Developers of currently existing productivity apps might come up with better ideas to organize and plan.e

## Evidence
### 1. Watch History Tracking (Anime)
[How many people watch anime? (2025)](https://headphonesaddict.com/anime-statistics/#:~:text=Matija%20Ferjan,the%20animation%20category%20in%202022.)
- States that more than a third of the world population, or 2.88 billion people, watch anime.
- Over 100 million households globally watched at least 1 anime title on Netflix in 2020.
- Anime is the 3rd most in-demand subgenre worldwide, with a 5.5% demand share.

[Anime DataBase](https://anidb.net/)
- Stats from Anime database show that there are 14100 animes out there in the world.

[MyanimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?limit=23885)
- Stats from MAL says there are 23885 animes in the world. The point is that the anime population and the viewer population are all massive and totally furfills.

#### Comparibles
[MyAnimeList (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net/): The largest anime tracking platform (launched 2004) with a massive database and community. It popularized the list system and has millions of users, but its aging interface and lack of automation are drawbacks ([Switching from MyAnimeList](https://thecartdriver.wordpress.com/2021/11/04/i-switched-from-using-myanimelist-to-anilist-and-heres-a-quick-review/#:~:text=MAL%20has%20had%20some%20dodgy,and%20become%20my%20MAL%20replacement))

[Anime-Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/):An anime and manga tracker founded in 2001 “by fans, for fans.” It reaches over 5 million monthly users worldwide and offers legal streaming links in partnership with publishers. Anime-Planet allows tracking and personalized recommendations, but like MAL it requires manual updates [Anime-Planet Strikes Deal With Lezhin Comics](https://www.animationmagazine.net/zh-CN/2020/08/lezhin-comics-strikes-exclusives-deal-with-anime-planet/)

[AniList](https://anilist.co/): A modern anime tracking site that has gained popularity for its clean UI and customization. AniList lets users import MAL data and even choose scoring scales. Notably, it shows at a glance which airing shows you’re watching and how many episodes you’re behind – a quality-of-life feature MAL lacks. AniList’s design (launched mid-2010s) feels more contemporary, with active development. Limitation: It still requires manual check-ins per episode (no native auto-tracking), and, like all such sites, it lists each season of a series separately, which some find “actively unhelpful” for discovery. Its community is smaller than MAL’s, so social aspects or obscure content info might be less robust. [MAL vs Anilist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aPPVIOGhcU)


[Kitsu (formerly Hummingbird)](https://kitsu.app/explore/anime): A social anime tracking platform that started in 2013, rebranded to Kitsu after a 2016 seed investment by Viz Media. Kitsu introduced a modern feed and global community posts, aiming to feel more “alive” than MAL. It emphasizes a slick design and a strong sense of community ownership. Limitations: Despite early promise, Kitsu’s user base remains niche – years later one redditor joked that “as one of the 20 Kitsu users, yes it’s been dead for years” [Dead Site](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/18l2jy9/is_kitsu_a_dead_platform/#:~:text=Is%20kitsu%20a%20dead%20platform,people%20that%20still%20use%20it)

### 2. Inventory Tracking (Jewelry)
[Time Lost Searching](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lost-and-found-the-average-american-spends-25-days-each-year-looking-for-lost-items-collectively-costing-us-households-27-billion-annually-in-replacement-costs-300449305.html)Americans spend ~2.5 days per year looking for lost items, costing households $2.7 billion annually in replacements—small jewelry pieces are a major culprit given their tendency to get misplaced.

[Unworn Fashion](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes) A WRAP study found that around 30% of clothing in UK wardrobes (≈1.7 billion items) had not been worn in a year—showing that people forget or underuse items they already own.

[Lost Items](https://www.hippo.com/blog/home-inventory-apps) Americans spend ~2.5 days per year searching for lost belongings, costing households $2.7B annually in replacements. Jewelry, being small and easily misplaced, is especially prone to this.

[DIY Organization](https://www.containerstore.com/organization-projects/closet/project/organize-jewelry) Countless DIY blogs and retailers promote jewelry organization projects (trays, boxes, racks), evidence that casual owners often struggle to keep track of their pieces.

[Reddit: Jewelry Inventory Struggles](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1c77ho6/i_have_no_idea_how_to_do_inventory_for_my_jewelry/) Small jewelry sellers on Reddit admit to using notebooks or ad-hoc methods for inventory, highlighting the lack of simple, consumer-friendly tracking tools.

[Etsy Template](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1506814229/jewelry-collection-tracker-jewelry) Popular spreadsheet templates exist to track jewelry collections by count, value, and photos—evidence of demand, though manual entry makes them clunky.

### 3: High-effort Logging (Productivity)
[Gamify is big in the marcket](https://www.amplifai.com/blog/gamification-statistics#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20data%20say%3F): In workplace settings, around 90% of employees reported that gamified systems make them more productive at work

[Media Multi-tasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_multitasking)Heavy media multitasking is associated with worse cognitive performance, slower responses, and increased errors—highlighting that “busyness” doesn’t equal effectiveness.

[Struggle to Focus](https://cruciallearning.com/press/failure-to-focus/)A Crucial Learning survey found that 68% of people struggle to focus at work and 62% at home. Moreover, nearly one-third can attend to a task for only 10 minutes or less before being disrupted.

#### Comparibles
[Habitica](habitica.com)The poster child of gamified habit trackers, Habitica “treats your real life like a game”. Users create an avatar, earn XP (experience points) and gold for completing tasks, and take damage for failing habits.Limitations: The RPG style can be too involved or gimmicky for some – if you’re not into the 8-bit fantasy aesthetic, the interface might feel cluttered. Also, as a general tool, Habitica might lack specialized features (for example, it’s less suited for team project management or detailed scheduling compared to dedicated apps).

[MagicTask](magictask.io) MagicTask uses a system where completing tasks earns points to unlock new themes and sound effects for the app interface. It even has leaderboards to compete with others or your team.
Limitations: MagicTask’s game elements (themes, cosmetic rewards) might be less compelling

[SuperBetter](https://superbetter.com/)An app created by game designer Jane McGonigal, SuperBetter takes a wellness-oriented approach to gamification. Rather than tracking every daily chore, it sets up “quests” and “power-ups” to build personal resilience and healthy habits.
Limitations: It’s less about traditional productivity/to-dos – so it might not help you track work tasks or study schedules in detail. Also, lacking a strong game theme might make it less immersive for some.

[Jace AI - Your 24/7 AI Email Agent](https://jace.ai/) Jace AI is an intelligent assistant that drafts email replies in your voice, organizes your inbox, schedules meetings, and “calms chaos before you open your laptop”.[Email automation](https://medium.com/%40daneallist/meet-jace-ai-revolutionizing-autonomous-artificial-intelligence-agents-92fc4fa186c8).
Limitation: Currently limited to Gmail; lacks native support for Outlook or other clients. Some users express privacy concerns, including a dramatic review warning, “STAY AWAY: Jace AI threatens to release your private emails.” [Reviews](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/Jace)

[Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)
Forest is a popular focus/productivity app where the “game” is growing a virtual tree. When you want to focus, you plant a seed in the app and a timer starts; if you leave the app (i.e., get distracted by your phone), your tree dies.
Limitations: Very narrow in scope. It doesn’t manage a task list or habits; it addresses only the time-management facet of productivity.

## Features
### 1. Watch History Tracking (Anime)

**1. “Beli” Algorithm**
A rating system that compares two anime you watch and slowly learn your own ratins of animes. This helps anime watchers discover what to watch next and also understand their own taste, also its good to share these "hot takes" to friends.

**2. Anime Shelf**
A visual bookshelf where shows you’re watching, completed, or paused are displayed like volumes in a manga shelf. This makes progress tracking more engaging and intuitive, and gives friends/social groups a shared visual language when discussing shows.

**3. Language Selection for All Anime**
An option to toggle between English, Chinese, or Japanese titles for every show and episode. This bridges the gap for multilingual anime fans and directly addresses the social disconnect stakeholders experience when watching in different languages.

---

### 2. Inventory Tracking (Jewelry)

**1. Digital Shelf**
A photo-driven catalog where each piece of jewelry can be uploaded with images, tags, and metadata (material, type, style). Jewelry owners gain a clear visual overview, reducing duplicate purchases and helping rediscover forgotten items.

**2. Location Tagging**
Each entry includes a field to document where the jewelry is physically stored (drawer, box, case). This reduces the wasted time that owners and their peers experience when trying to find specific pieces, directly addressing the “lost item” problem.

**3. Robust Search & Filter**
A smart search that lets users find jewelry by type, occasion, or even color/material. This empowers owners to quickly assemble outfits, helps friends/peers see what might be borrowed, and gives retailers insights into usage patterns if connected to commerce.

---

### 3. High-effort Logging (Productivity)

**1. Level Up With Tasks**
Completing tasks grants experience points for an avatar that levels up over time. Students/young professionals are rewarded visually for consistency, keeping them motivated without extra manual effort.

**2. Passive Time Tracking**
A background timer that automatically detects focused sessions (e.g., typing, reading, coding) and logs them without user input. This directly addresses the stakeholder frustration with “too much effort” in current apps.

**3. Task-to-Reward Converter**
Instead of just checking a box, tasks can generate small rewards like coins, badges, or virtual items (e.g., for a pet or avatar). This benefits app developers (higher retention) and users by making progress tangible and enjoyable.
